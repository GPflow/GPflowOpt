class Acquisition(Parameterized):
    """
    An acquisition function maps the belief represented by a Bayesian model into a
    score indicating how promising a point is for evaluation.

    In Bayesian Optimization this function is typically optimized over the optimization domain
    to determine the next point for evaluation. An object of this class holds a list of GPflow models. Subclasses
    implement a build_acquisition function which computes the acquisition function (usually from the predictive
    distribution) using TensorFlow. Optionally, a method setup can be implemented which computes some quantities which
    are used to compute the acquisition, but do not depend on candidate points.

    Acquisition functions can be combined through addition or multiplication to construct joint criteria. For instance,
    for constrained optimization. The objects then form a tree hierarchy.

    Acquisition models implement a lazy strategy to optimize models and run setup. This is implemented by a _needs_setup
    attribute (similar to the _needs_recompile in GPflow). Calling :meth:`set_data` sets this flag to True. Calling methods
    marked with the setup_require decorator (such as evaluate) optimize all models, then call setup if this flag is set.
    In hierarchies, first acquisition objects handling constraint objectives are set up, then the objects handling
    objectives.
