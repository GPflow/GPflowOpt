    An acquisition function maps the belief represented by a Bayesian model into a

    An object of this class holds a list of GPflow models. Subclasses implement a build_acquisition function
    which computes the acquisition function (usually from the predictive distribution) using TensorFlow.
    Each model is automatically optimized when an acquisition object is constructed or when set_data is called.

    Acquisition functions can be combined through addition or multiplication to construct joint criteria.
