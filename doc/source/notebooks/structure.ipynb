    "The underlying design principles of GPflowOpt were chosen to address the following task: optimizing problems of the form\n",
    "$$\\underset{\\boldsymbol{x} \\in \\mathcal{X}}{\\operatorname{argmin}} f(\\boldsymbol{x}).$$ The *objective function* $f: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^p$ maps a candidate optimum to a score (or multiple). Here $\\mathcal{X}$ represents the input domain. This domain encloses all candidate solutions to the optimization problem and can be entirely continuous (i.e., a $d$-dimensional hypercube) but may also consist of discrete and categorical parameters. \n",

    "### Objective function\n",
    "The objective function itself is provided and must be implemented as any python callable (function or object with implemented call operator), accepting a two dimensional numpy array with shape $(n, d)$ as an input, with $n$ the batch size. It returns a tuple of numpy arrays: the first element of the tuple has shape $(n, p)$ and returns the objective scores for each point to evaluate. The second element is the gradient in every point, shaped either $(n, d)$ if we have a single-objective optimization problem, or $(n, d, p)$ in case of a multi-objective function. If the objective function is passed on to a gradient-free optimization method, the gradient is automatically discarded. GPflowOpt provides decorators which handle batch application of a function along the n points of the input matrix, or dealing with functions which accept each feature as function argument.\n",

    "In Bayesian Optimization (BO), the typical assumption is that $f$ is expensive to evaluate and no gradients are available. The typical approach is to sequentially select a limited set of decisions $\\boldsymbol{x}_0, \\boldsymbol{x}_1, ... \\boldsymbol{x}_{n-1}$ using a sampling policy. Hence each decision $\\boldsymbol{x}_i \\in \\mathcal{X}$ itself is the result of an optimization problem\n",

    "Each iteration, a function $\\alpha_i$ which is cheap-to-evaluate acts as a surrogate for the expensive function. It is typically a mapping of the predictive distribution of a (Bayesian) model built on all decisions and their corresponding (noisy) evaluations. The mapping introduces an order in $\\mathcal{X}$ to obtain a certain goal. The typical goal within the context of BO is the search for *optimality* or *feasibility* while keeping the amount of required evaluations ($n$) a small number. As we can have several functions $f$ representing objectives and constraints, BO may invoke several models and mappings $\\alpha$. These mappings are typically referred to as *acquisition functions* (or *infill criteria*). GPflowOpt defines an `Acquisition` interface to implement these mappings and provides implementations of some default choices. In combination with a special `Optimizer` implementation for BO, following steps are required for a typical workflow: \n",

GPflowOpt does not further wrap models hence it is possible to implement custom models in GPflow and use them directly in GPflowOpt\n",
